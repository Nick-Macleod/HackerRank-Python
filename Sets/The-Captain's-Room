# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
K=int(input())

# Note: in Python, map creates and object to iterate over, BUT once it is iterated
# over it is consumed. In this case, if you immediately create a set of the rooms
# you will consume the list (this was my first attempt). THUS, we should first 
# create a list of the rooms, and use this list to create the set.

# Approach: 

rooms=map(int,input().split())
rooms=list(rooms)
#print(rooms)
set_of_rooms=set(rooms)
#print(set_of_rooms)

# Assume Captain in room i, and other rooms are j_l, then total rooms will be
# Eq1=K*sum(j_l)+i=K*[sum(j_l)+i]-(K-1)i, thus i=[sum(rooms)-Eq1]/K-1

print(int((sum(set_of_rooms)*K-sum(rooms))/(K-1)))
